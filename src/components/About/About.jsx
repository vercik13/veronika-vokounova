              I enjoy frontend development and software testing â€“ I find it rewarding to help create applications that not only perform well but are also enjoyable to use.

For over a year and a half, I have been working in manual testing of web applications, mainly e-commerce websites. I have experience in bug hunting, testing new features, and verifying that everything works as expected by users. I am also gradually learning automated testing and have basic experience with Cypress, Puppeteer, and Playwright.

In addition to testing, I enjoy frontend development. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I enjoy fine-tuning interfaces to ensure they make sense both visually and functionally.

I am looking for opportunities where I can continue to grow, learn from more experienced colleagues, and gradually specialize in automated testing or frontend development.
